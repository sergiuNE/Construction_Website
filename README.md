### 🏗️ Construction Company Website  

Designed and developed a modern website for a construction company using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. <br>  
The site includes a 🌐 multilingual dropdown menu, enabling seamless content translation to support a diverse, global audience, and is optimized for usability across phones, tablets, and laptops. Additionally, I implemented a **PHP-based contact form** that allows users to send emails directly to the CEO.
